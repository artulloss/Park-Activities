# Final exam

Prompt

The final exam programming assignment will focus on creating a web “application” (interface) that will provide a user the ability to query an API. Your application will need to implement the following requirements:

Usage of a web API approved per the Final Exam Proposal assignment. I suggest that you pick a well-documented API that
supports a JSON data format for easier JavaScript consumption.
- At least one web page that provides
a search field that a user can enter values to search for items in the API
- a result listing of the search dumped into an HTML table or jQuery Datatable (or
equivalent).
- The result listing must include additional fields besides the search
parameter fields.
- a button or link or some mechanism to click on each result and be presented
with a dialog/page/dynamic section of detailed information of the particular item
- Your solution must incorporate Ajax for calling the API
- Your solution must have event handlers for submitting the query (e.g, form submittal or button click)
- Your solution must incorporate data validation for at least one of the query fields (data type, length, etc.)
- Your solution must follow our best practices this semester (strict grading on these):
  - External JavaScript libraries (no embedded JavaScript in HTML)
  - Usage of functions
  - Clean code (usage of let/const for variable declarations, good naming, brief comments, etc.). Remember - less code is more! I should be able to quickly discern the intent of functions and variables by their names.
  - Your solution must _work_ to avoid a major deduction.
